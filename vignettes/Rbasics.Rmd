## R as a calculator

One of the most simple things we can do with R is to use it as a kind of calculator. We can do all elementary arithmetic operations:

    >1 + 1
    [1] 2
    >1 - 1
    [1] 0
    >2 * 3
    [1] 6
    >2 / 3
    [1] 0.6666667

Here we use '>' to denote the R prompt. It is used in the console to indicate that R is ready for a new command. The lines in between is the output given by R.

A lot of the functionality in R comes from its functions. There are many functions we can use including the standard mathematical ones:
   >cos(3.1415)
   [1] -1
   >exp(0)
   [1] 1
   >log(1)
   [1] 0

## Variables

The results above are displayed but not stored. To do this we must give a name to the result. That is we store the result in a variable. The results are now no longer displayed but they are given a name that we can use later to refer to the value we stored in it.
Assigning a result in a variable is done using `<-`. For example:

    >five <- 3+3
    > five
    [1] 5
    > five + 1
    [1] 6
    
Each variable has a class that determines for a large extend what we can do with it. 

## R packages and the library command

As mentioned above R is a modular language that we can extend using packages. We can load a package using the command `library()`. So if we want to load the `survival` package (in order to do survival analysis ) we type:

    >library(survival)

Before we can load a library it must be installed. This can be done using the command `install.packages(packagename)` where `packagename` is the name of the package between single or double quotes. For example:

    >install.packages('gamlss')
    
## Documentation

The functions `help` en `?` can be used to read the documentation on a particular subject (mostly functions). The package in which the function is defined must be loaded. Using `help.search` and `??` we can search the documentation files in a more general way. 

    >?library
    >help(install.packages)
    >help.search('logistic regression')
